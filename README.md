# 🎲 Game Theory
This repository contains the notes for the Game Theory course with Professor Song. The content covers the first four chapters of the book "An Introduction to Game Theory" by M. Osborne, including the Introduction chapter and the three chapters with names matching those of the PDF files.

## 📚 Contents
The following chapters from the book are covered:
- Nash Equilibrium
- Illustrations
- Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium
Each note includes:
- Main ideas and concepts from the book  
- Solved exercises and proofs   
- Personal strategies for understanding and solving problems
🔗 **[Handwritten Notes in Goodnotes (link)](https://web.goodnotes.com/s/mByxgkG6YL8CuZMEAIYJ0y#page-1)**  
Contains summaries, proofs, annotated diagrams, and solutions to selected theorems.

## 🧾 Key Results
Here's a list of some problems/proofs that were gone over during discussion and proven either rigorously or visually/intuitively (this list may not be comprehensive):  

🧱 **Pure Strategy Game**:
- The derivation of a 2x2 game with *no* Nash equilibrium.
- Definition of **symmetrical game** with an example of a game containing 3 players.
- The exclusion of strictly dominated actions in a Nash equilibrium.
- Discussion of 2 games being equivalent if we can rename the actions and players so that the utility functions give the same ordering in both games. For example, **Prisoners' Dilemma** and **The Nuclear Arms Race** are equivalent.
	- If both games are symmetrical, we only need to check that a pair of players containing one from each game shares the same utility function for both games to be equivalent.
- If a Nash equilibrium contains all *strictly dominating* actions, then it is **unique**. (This is rather a weak result)
  
🏭 **Cournot's Economic Game**:
- For a homogeneous game, each firm produces the exact same quantity $q_i$. Moreover, as the number of firms increases, the price approaches the cost of making a product. In other words, the firms are barely braking even.
- For a more general game, we have the result of the equilibrium price being at least the cost of producing a product, but if the total output increases by $q$, where $q$ minimizes the cost per product function for each firm, then all firms would lose money.
  
🎲 **Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium**:
- Two Bernoulli payoff functions $u$ and $v$ are equivalent for the same player in the same game if and only if $u=av+b$ for some $a>0$ and $b$.
- Every mixed strategy game has a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. A 
There are other problems, theorems, or topics being discussed that were not mentioned here as well, such as the use of the **Fixed Point Theorem** in topics such as Optimization.

## 💡 Additional Resources
- Summaries and strategies are available as handwritten notes (link above).
- Visual diagrams help build intuition about equilibria and strategies.
- Topics not listed here may include evolutionary game theory, bargaining games, and auctions.
